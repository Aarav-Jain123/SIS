Wiring Diagram
Soil Moisture Sensor:

VCC → Arduino 5V
GND → Arduino GND
Analog Output (A0) → Arduino Analog Pin A0
Relay Module (5V):

VCC → Arduino 5V
GND → Arduino GND
IN → Arduino Digital Pin 7
The relay’s NO (Normally Open) terminal connects to one side of the water pump’s power input, while the other side of the water pump’s power input connects to the Arduino GND.
Water Pump:

Positive terminal connects to the relay’s NO terminal
Negative terminal connects to GND
Battery (9V):

Connected to the Arduino’s power input to power the board.
